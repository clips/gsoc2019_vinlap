# viNLaP: Visualizing polarized data sources

This project was conceived due to the need of visualize polarized data easily and effectively. The first version of vinLAp aims to show an overview of the MAGA corpus, crawled in GSoC 2018 by Maja Goudoz- For doing so, it focuses on three aspects. These aspects are: variability of the vocabulary by each side using Scattertexts, speech production by geographic regions using GeoSpeech and, speech generation analysis from a specific word using Speech Igniters.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine.

### Prerequisites

This project runs with Python 3.7. We use Jupyter notebooks for the development of each aspect, to create everything dynamically. 

Install the following dependencies:

```
pip install pandas 
pip install seaborn 
pip install unicodedata
pip install nltk
pip install numpy
pip install networkx
pip install matplotlib
pip install scattertext
pip install tweepy
pip install datetime
pip install quantiphy
```

## Structure of the repo

In [data](/data), you will find:

### [tweets_maga](/data/tweets_maga.json) 

This dataset is a extension of the previous colleted MAGA corpus. It has the complete json object of each tweet. We hope this data will help other research in the future.

In [notebooks](/notebooks), you will find:

### [GeoSpeech](/notebooks/GeoSpeech.ipynb) 

This dataset is a extension of the previous colleted MAGA corpus. It has the complete json object of each tweet. We hope this data will help other research in the future.

### [GeoSpeech](/notebooks/GeoSpeech.ipynb) 

This dataset is a extension of the previous colleted MAGA corpus. It has the complete json object of each tweet. We hope this data will help other research in the future.

### [GeoSpeech](/notebooks/GeoSpeech.ipynb) 

This dataset is a extension of the previous colleted MAGA corpus. It has the complete json object of each tweet. We hope this data will help other research in the future.

### [GeoSpeech](/notebooks/GeoSpeech.ipynb) 

This dataset is a extension of the previous colleted MAGA corpus. It has the complete json object of each tweet. We hope this data will help other research in the future.
